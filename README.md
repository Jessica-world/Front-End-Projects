**#HTML+CSS**

It has different projects which I created using Html and CSS specially the flexbox concept to make it responsive and flexible.
Following are some projects that I created:-

**1.Bagnic-Online Bags store**
The landing page for Bagnic is a conceptual creation, not an actual website, envisioned purely in the realm of imagination.
**2.Huel-Nutritionally Complete Food**
It features a landing page inspired by the original website, Huel.com
